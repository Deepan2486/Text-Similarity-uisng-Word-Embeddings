1. This code compares doc1.txt file with doc2.txt file and displays the similarity %
2. Load packages: TENSORFLOW and TENSORFLOW_HUB
3. Load the ELMo model from Tensorflow_hub using 'https://tfhub.dev/google/elmo/2'
4. define a function called elmo_vectors(x) that returns the ELMo embedding for each tokenized sentence to be passed and made to a vector.
